Introduction to Hammer
===============================

Hammer (Higly Agile Masks Made Efforlessly from RTL) is a framework for building physical design generators for digital VLSI flows. It is an evolving set of APIs that enable reuse in an effort to speed up VLSI flows, which have traditionally been entirely rebuilt for different projects, technologies, and tools.

Hammer is able to generate scripts and collateral for a growing range of CAD tools while remaining technology-agnostic using a well-defined set of common APIs. Tool- and technology-specific concerns live inside plugins, implement APIs, and provide a set of working default configurations.

The vision of Hammer is to reduce the cycle time on VLSI designs, enabling rapid RTL design space exploration and allowing a designer to investigate the impact of various parameters like timing constraints and floorplans without needing to worry about low-level details.
