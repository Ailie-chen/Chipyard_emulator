FireMarshal
==================================

This tool builds base images for several linux-based distros that work with qemu,
spike, and firesim.

This is just a quick primer. To see full documentation, please see the official
documentation:
https://firemarshal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

# Requirements
The easiest way to use Marshal is to run it via Chipyard
(https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or FireSim
(https://docs.fires.im/en/latest/). However, this is not required. To run
FireMarshal independently, you will need the following dependencies:

## Standard Packages
centos-requirements.txt is a list of packages for centos7 that are needed by
marshal. You can install these with:
```
cat centos-requirements.txt | sudo xargs yum install -y
```

Package names may be different on other distributions.

### Note for Ubuntu
The libguestfs-tools package (needed for the guestmount command) does not work
out of the box on Ubuntu. See
https://github.com/firesim/firesim-software/issues/30 for a workaround.

## Python
This project was written for python 3.6. You can install all dependencies using:
```
pip3 install -r python-requirements.txt
```

## RISC-V Tools
In addition to standard libraries, you will need a RISC-V compatible toolchain,
the RISC-V isa simulator (spike).

See the [Chipyard documentation](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Chipyard-Basics/Initial-Repo-Setup.html#building-a-toolchain)
for help setting up a known-good toolchain and environment.

## Qemu
Qemu is the default simulator used by firemarshal. We require version v5.0.0 or
greater. If you aren't using chipyard, you can get it from:

https://github.com/qemu/qemu/tree/v5.0.0

# Basic Usage
If you only want to build bare-metal workloads, you can skip updating
submodules. Otherwise, you should update the required submodules by running:

    ./init-submodules.sh

Building workloads:

    ./marshal build br-base.json

To run in qemu:

    ./marshal launch br-base.json

To install into FireSim (assuming you cloned this as a submodule of firesim or chipyard):

    ./marshal install br-base.json

# Security Note
Be advised that FireMarshal will run initialization scripts provided by
workloads. These scripts will have all the permissions your user has, be sure
to read all workloads carefully before building them.
