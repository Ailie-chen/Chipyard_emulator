.. _fedora-distro:

The Fedora Distribution
=============================
Fedora is based on a recent developer release of the RISC-V Fedora Linux
distribution. You can find more information on the `Fedora Wiki
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V>`_.

The distro is quite large and takes significantly longer to boot than simpler
distros like :ref:`buildroot <buildroot-distro>`. However, it supports the full
Fedora package management repositories and can handle more complex benchmarks.

Fedora currently does not expose any distribution options.
