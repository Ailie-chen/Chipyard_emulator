Contributing to FireMarshal
=============================

## Contributing Changes
We welcome contributions to FireMarshal through [github
PRs](https://github.com/firesim/FireMarshal/pulls). **All PRs should be against
the dev branch**. Master is only updated by the FireMarshal maintainers and
serves as the stable release branch.

Before submitting a PR:
* Merge origin/dev to ensure you have the latest changes.
* Run ./full_test.sh to ensure the basic unit-tests still work

## Getting Help / Discussion:
* For general questions, help, and discussion: use the FireSim user forum: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/firesim
* For bugs and feature requests: use the github issue tracker: https://github.com/firesim/FireMarshal/issues

## Branch management:
1) **master**: Stable release. Updated by FireMarshal maintainers as part of a release. 
2) **dev**: Unstable development. Dev should (hopefully) work at all times, but
   there are no guarantees. All changes should be PRd against dev. 
3) **All other branches**: Private development branches, typically not suitable for use.
