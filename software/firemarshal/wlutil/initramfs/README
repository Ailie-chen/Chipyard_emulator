This directory contains utilities for constructing initramfs's. Each
subdirectory can be included in the linux CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE option. 

# disk
This is the initramfs for disk-based workloads. It contains a fully-functioning
self-contained initramfs that will load drivers automatically.

# no-disk
This simply contains a /init script that loads platform drivers and calls the
distro's /sbin/init. It is intended to be appended to a rootfs cpio that was
created from a normal disk image.

# drivers
This archive contains the board's platform drivers in a
/lib/modules/KERNELVERSION/ directory. You should append this to an initramfs
cpio to provide drivers.

# devNodes.cpio
A prebuilt archive containing the required special files in dev/. Specifically
/dev/console and /dev/tty.
