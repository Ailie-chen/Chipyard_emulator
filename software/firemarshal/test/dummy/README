This workload just runs an infinite loop bare-metal. It's occasionally useful
if you'd like to have a firesim node up and running, but not doing anything
(maybe it's an accelerator that doesn't need SW). This may become uneccessary
in the future.

Note: 'launch' is set to false here, this prevents firesim-software from trying
to run this workload (you'd have to kill it manually). Firesim itself will
still run it.
