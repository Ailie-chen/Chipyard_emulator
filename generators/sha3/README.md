# SHA3 RoCC Accelerator

This is an accelerator that implements the Secure Hash Algorithm 3.
It is mainly meant to be used in the
[Chipyard development environment](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard)
but can be ported to other environments (i.e. plain
[Rocket Chip](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip)).
For more information on how the accelerator works, please refer to the
[SHA3 documentation in Chipyard](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Generators/SHA3.html).

# Software Workloads

See [software/README.md](software/README.md) for more information on building software tests for this
accelerator.
