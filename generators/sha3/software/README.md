# SHA3 Software Workloads

This is an example set of workloads that uses the SHA3 rocc accelerator.

# Getting Started

Since SHA3 accelerator uses custom instruction not supported by the vanilla toolchain, 
these workloads require a modified version of Spike simulator to build, which can be found
[here](https://github.com/ucb-bar/esp-isa-sim). If you are using Chipyard, make sure to source
`env.sh` (or if you also have vanilla toolchain installed, `env-esp-tools.sh`). Otherwise, make sure 
the Spike executable is in your `PATH`.

To run linux-based workloads, you'll also need to update the linux submodule:

    cd sha3
    git submodule update --init software/linux

These workloads all use FireMarshal to build and test. All the examples in this
README assume that marshal is on your PATH, if not, replace all calls to
marshal with the path to the marshal command (e.g.
`../../../software/firemarshal/marshal` if you're in chipyard).

The first time you build a workload using FireMarshal, the `build.sh` script
will be run automatically. This script compiles all of our dependencies (e.g.
Linux and our custom software simulator, spike).

# Workloads

All workload configuration files are in `marshal-configs`.

## Bare-Metal

There are two different bare-metal workloads that are packaged in this repository. `sha3-bare-rocc` uses the SHA3
accelerator to run a SHA3 computation. The `sha3-bare-sw` instead computes the SHA3 hash using software only.

    sha3-bare-rocc.json
    sha3-bare-sw.json

To build either binary run:

    ./marshal build marshal-configs/sha3-bare-rocc.json
    ./marshal build marshal-configs/sha3-bare-sw.json

To run the test interactively run:

    ./marshal launch --spike marshal-configs/sha3-bare-rocc.json
    ./marshal launch --spike marshal-configs/sha3-bare-sw.json

To run the unit test run:

    ./marshal test --spike marshal-configs/sha3-bare-rocc.json
    ./marshal test --spike marshal-configs/sha3-bare-sw.json

## Linux

***sha3-linux*.json***

The linux-based workloads can boot in qemu so long as you don't actually access
the rocc accelerator. To use the custom hardware, you must boot in spike:

    ./marshal --nodisk build marshal-configs/sha3-linux.json
    ./marshal --nodisk launch --spike marshal-configs/sha3-linux.json

The `--nodisk` option tells marshal to build the root filesystem into the
binary as an initial ram filesystem (this is needed because spike does not
include a disk model). The `--spike` option tells marshal to boot the image in
spike (the custom spike we provided in this case).

### Interactive Linux

***sha3-linux.json***

This workload boots buildroot and uses the SHA3 accelerator as a user-space
program. The basic workload boots into an interactive session. You can look at
`/root/linux` in the target for binaries to execute. `sha3-sw` acts as a
baseline and computes the hash in software only. `sha3-rocc` uses the rocc
accelerator to compute the hash.

### Automated Linux Test

***sha3-linux-test.json***

This workload inherits from sha3-linux.json and adds a 'command' field that
tells marshal to run a command automatically when the workload runs. It also
adds a 'testing' field that provides a reference output for Marshal to compare
against when running `./marshal test marshal-configs/sha3-linux-test.json`. Note that
in Marshal, the reference output needs to match some subset of the actual
output (notice that `test-reference/linux/sha3-linux-test/uartlog` only has the
test output, while the actual program output is much longer.

To use this workload, try running:

    ./marshal --nodisk test --spike marshal-configs/sha3-linux-test.json

# Key Components of this Workload

## riscv-linux

The default Linux kernel does not support rocc instructions. Instead, we must
use a fork. You can check the git log to see which changes we made.

The first two commits fix known incompatibilities between Linux and FireSim
(mostly relating to device tree differences). The final commit enables rocc
instructions by setting a CSR at thread creation time.

## riscv-isa-sim and spike-sha3

This is the standard riscv isa simulator (also known as 'spike'). We have
modified it to contain a golden model of our SHA3 accelerator. In the case of
rocc accelerators, we can build the golden model out-of-tree (in the spike-sha3
directory) and simply have it installed along-side the standard spike. See
`build.sh` for how this is done.

We install our custom spike to `spike-local`. Marshal is able to use this local
copy instead of the system-provided spike.

## marshal-configs

This directory contains our FireMarshal configurations for each workload.

## test-reference

This directory contains reference outputs for each of our automated test
workloads.

## linux-benchmarks

Contains sources for our linux-based benchmarks. This directory is coppied into
the root directory of our Linux workloads. These are cross-compiled by the
`build.sh` script (run by FireMarshal when building the workload).

## bare-benchmarks

Contains sources for the bare-metal benchmarks and unit tests. These are
cross-compiled by the `build.sh` script (run by FireMarshal when building the
workload). These benchmarks contain all of the code necessary to boot and run
on a bare-metal system (e.g. the c runtime and a basic implementation of common
system functions).

## jtr

Contains a fork of John the Ripper that targets the SHA3 accelerator.
